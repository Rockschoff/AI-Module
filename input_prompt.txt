Why traditional systems don\xe2\x80\x99t work
In traditional systems, thousands of tasks are interwoven into complex plans, which are difficult and error prone.
Schedules are wrong; non-critical tasks often get priority over critical ones. Manual adjustments to course correct are onerous. Making the plans even more complex.
Then, new tasks emerge in execution. The order of the work keeps changing. Which makes it impossible to keep complex plans current.
To compensate, workarounds are created. Spreadsheets and back pocket plans. Dashboards and slides. None of which can be linked or easily reconciled.
It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise status and schedules are never reliable. And projects are always late.

Plans stay relevant in execution.
 Teams are synchronized and managers get early warning signals.\xe2\x80\x9d
