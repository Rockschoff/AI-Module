Why traditional systems don\xe2\x80\x99t work
In traditional systems, thousands of tasks are interwoven into complex plans, which are difficult and error prone.
Schedules are wrong; non-critical tasks often get priority over critical ones. Manual adjustments to course correct are onerous. Making the plans even more complex.
Then, new tasks emerge in execution. The order of the work keeps changing. Which makes it impossible to keep complex plans current.
To compensate, workarounds are created. Spreadsheets and back pocket plans. Dashboards and slides. None of which can be linked or easily reconciled.
It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise status and schedules are never reliable. And projects are always late.
SMART PROJECT CONTROL
The SMART Project Map is a leap forward
It differentiates planning from execution
PLANNING TIER
This is a delivery roadmap with supertasks. It captures managerial decisions about resource allocation, risk reduction, staging of materials, etc. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple and rarely changes.
EXECUTION TIER
This captures detailed activities inside each supertask. It\xe2\x80\x99s flexible and can be updated on the fly by the frontline, or automatically from Engineering and ERP systems.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe flow of information between the two tiers is automated.
Plans stay relevant in execution.
 Teams are synchronized and managers get early warning signals.\xe2\x80\x9d
