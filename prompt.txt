SMART
 PROJECT CONTROL IS ENABLED BY TWO KEY INNOVATIONS

SMART SCHEDULING
keeps teams working on the right tasks, and executives solving the right problems. To achieve uniterrupted execution. Even amidst always changing conditions.

Why traditional systems don\xe2\x80\x99t work
In traditional systems, thousands of tasks are interwoven into complex plans, which are difficult and error prone.
Schedules are wrong; non-critical tasks often get priority over critical ones. Manual adjustments to course correct are onerous. Making the plans even more complex.
Then, new tasks emerge in execution. The order of the work keeps changing. Which makes it impossible to keep complex plans current.
To compensate, workarounds are created. Spreadsheets and back pocket plans. Dashboards and slides. None of which can be linked or easily reconciled.
It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise status and schedules are never reliable. And projects are always late.
SMART PROJECT CONTROL
The SMART Project Map is a leap forward
It differentiates planning from execution
PLANNING TIER
This is a delivery roadmap with supertasks. It captures managerial decisions about resource allocation, risk reduction, staging of materials, etc. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple and rarely changes.
EXECUTION TIER
This captures detailed activities inside each supertask. It\xe2\x80\x99s flexible and can be updated on the fly by the frontline, or automatically from Engineering and ERP systems.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe flow of information between the two tiers is automated.
Plans stay relevant in execution.
 Teams are synchronized and managers get early warning signals.\xe2\x80\x9d
SMART Scheduling provides reliable answers to big, tough questions
Will the project finish on time? If not, what should we focus on?
Which upcoming bottlenecks should we worry about?
Which routine delays are hurting us the most?
Which tasks should get resources next?
On multiple projects with shared resources, when can we safely start the next project?
Get the answers you need and change forever the way you think about projects.
SMART Project Control software is world-changing. It works in tandem with a powerful system of hard won practices. Offered at setup and available long-term.
Start delivering your projects on time.

He adds those steps on his plan. Followed them….
